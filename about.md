Hi, I'm Jonathan Dorsey.
This is where I write about some of my interests, mostly in programming and statistics.
I'm also interested in pure math (e.g. category theory), but I haven't put much of that here yet.

I'm always learning more about math, statistics, and programming, 
and of course, [I'm interested in most phases of data processing.](https://youtu.be/0bomkgXeDkE?t=213)

When I'm not reading or coding, I enjoy rock climbing.
