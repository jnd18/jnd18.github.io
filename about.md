Hi, I'm Jonathan Dorsey.
I've just completed my master's degree in statistics at the University of Akron.
Currently I'm looking for work as a data scientist, analyst, or statistician.
I went to Case Western Reserve University as an undergraduate and majored in math.

I'm always learning more about math, statistics, and programming. 
And of course, [I'm interested in most phases of data processing.](https://youtu.be/0bomkgXeDkE?t=213)

When I'm not reading or coding, I enjoy rock climbing.
