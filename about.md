I'm Jonathan Dorsey, a statistics graduate student at the University of Akron. 
Currently I'm working on my master's thesis and looking for work as a data scientist or analyst.
I went to Case Western Reserve University as an undergraduate and majored in math.

I'm always learning more about math, statistics, and programming. 
And of course, [I'm interested in most phases of data processing.](https://youtu.be/0bomkgXeDkE?t=213)

When I'm not reading or coding, I enjoy rock climbing.
