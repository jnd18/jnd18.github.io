title: Movie Recommendations via Matrix Factorization
---

I've written a little introduction to the topic of using matrix factorization algorithms for recommender systems.
It only just scratches the surface of what is possible, but I think it gets the main ideas across.
Check out the [Jupyter Notebook on my GitHub!](https://github.com/jnd18/mountain-project-recommender/blob/master/matrix-factorization.ipynb)
