title: Basic Bayesian Survival Analysis
---

During the fall of 2018 I took intro courses in bayesian statistics and survival analysis.
Both were taught by the same professor, and he made the interesting offer that we could do one final project for both classes,
so long as we could find a way to incorporate the core material of each course.
He actually recommended against this, claiming it would be harder overall, but I couldn't resist.
I ended up gathering my own data and writing my own Metroplis-within-Gibbs MCMC code, which I was quite proud of.
I typed up the paper in RMarkdown with text and code interleaved, so you can can see exactly how I produced my results.
Overall, it's a bit rough around the edges, but I still like it.
You can checkout the paper on GitHub [here.](https://github.com/jnd18/bayesian-survival-final-paper/blob/master/final_project_paper.pdf)
