title: "Names and Entropy"
---
The [babynames](https://github.com/hadley/babynames) package/dataset is a great playground for using tidyverse skills to answer questions with data. In this post, I'll explore the dataset a little bit before diving into my main question ("How is name diversity changing over time?") and answering it using the [Shannon entropy](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)>) as a measure of diversity. Check out the R Notebook on RPubs [here](http://rpubs.com/jnd18/name-entropy).
