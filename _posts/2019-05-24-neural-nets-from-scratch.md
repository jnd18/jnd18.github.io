title: Neural Nets from Scratch
---

A couple of years ago, when I was first learning about deep learning, I wrote my own little computational graph "library."
I put "library" in quotes because it was really just one small Python script implementing the core operations used for building up deep learning models.
I found the code the other day while looking through some old folders, and I thought I'd throw it up on my GitHub
with a little readme and a short demo.
Check it out [here.](https://github.com/jnd18/neural-nets-from-scratch)
If you want to learn more about deep learning and computational graphs, 
I highly recommend both the [cs231n notes](http://cs231n.github.io/) and the [deep learning book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
