title: Cleaning and Exploring Mountain Project Climbing Data
---

I've just put up a new Jupyter Notebook that shows off some basic data cleaning using Python and Pandas.
You can view on my GitHub [here.](https://github.com/jnd18/mountain-project-eda/blob/master/rrg-and-nrg.ipynb)
Here's a brief description from the intro of the notebook:
>Mountain Project is an online climbing guidebook for hundreds of thousands of routes all around the world.
>One of its cool features is a route finder that will create a table of routes based on certain parameters you give it, such as location and difficulty.
>You can then export this table as a .csv file.
>So I used this feature to download information about every roped climb in the Red River Gorge and New River Gorge,
>since these are the two major climbing destinations nearest to where I live, and they are places where I have actually climbed before.
>
>The main focus of this notebook is demonstrating some basic data cleaning with Pandas.
>But at the end I'll do a little exploratory analysis as a payoff for all that hard cleaning work.
>Another added bonus is that I demonstrate some quick and easy (but primitive) web scraping for gathering some data that the route finder doesn't export.
>
>Let's see if there's anything interesting we can learn about the climbing at the Red and the New!
