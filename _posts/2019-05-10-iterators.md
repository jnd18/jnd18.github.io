title: Iterables, Iterators, and Generators in Python
---

I've just finished working on a little Jupyter notebook that explains iterables, iterators, and generators in Python.
I've seen a lot of confusion regarding these topics, 
(My personal confusion: "I guess iterators are some kind of stream thingy? And then generators are...also some kind of stream thingy?"),
so I decided to really figure out exactly what these things are, and then write up what I learned for others (mainly future me).
You can check out the notebook on my GitHub [here.](https://github.com/jnd18/python-iter/blob/master/iterables-and-iterators.ipynb)
